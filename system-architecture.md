  # Part 2: System Architectures
Choosing the right architecture is like choosing the right foundation for your house — it decides how fast you can build, how easy it is to scale, and how well it handles change over time.

Here are the most common architectures you'll encounter, with real-world relevance and trade-offs.

### 1. Client-Server Architecture
Client-server architecture is a fundamental computing model that structures systems as service requesters (clients) and service providers (servers). This model has become the backbone of modern distributed computing, powering everything from web applications to enterprise systems.

#### Core Components
#### 1. Client
> Definition: A client is a device or software application that requests services or resources from a server

#### Characteristics:

- Initiates requests to servers
- Typically has a user interface
- May perform some local processing
- Examples: Web browsers, mobile apps, desktop applications

#### 2. Server
> Definition: A server is a powerful computer or software system that provides services, resources, or data to clients

#### Characteristics:

- Listens for client requests
- Processes requests and returns responses
- Typically more powerful than clients
- Examples: Web servers, database servers, file servers

#### Communication Protocols
- Client-server systems rely on standardized protocols for communication:
- HTTP/HTTPS: For web-based applications
- TCP/IP: Foundation for most internet communications
- WebSockets: For real-time, bidirectional communication
- gRPC: For high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Calls)
- GraphQL: For flexible data querying

#### Architectural Variations
#### 1. Two-Tier Architecture
- Simple model with direct client-server interaction
- Client handles presentation logic
- Server handles business logic and data storage
- Common in early web applications

#### 2. Three-Tier Architecture
- Presentation tier: User interface (client)
- Application tier: Business logic (server)
- Data tier: Database/storage (separate server)
- Provides better scalability and separation of concerns

#### 3. N-Tier Architecture
- Further divides application into additional specialized layers
- May include separate tiers for caching, API gateways, etc.
- Enables microservices patterns

### 🧱 2. Monolithic Architecture – The All-in-One Giant

#### 💡 What is Monolithic Architecture?

A **monolithic architecture** is a software design pattern where **all components of an application are built, deployed, and run as a single unit**. This includes:

- User interface (frontend)
- Business logic (backend logic, validations)
- Data access layer (database interactions)
- Third-party integrations (payments, email, etc.)

All these modules exist within **one codebase** and are compiled or deployed together.

#### 📦 Think of It Like:
A Swiss Army knife — everything in one piece. Great when starting out, but clunky to maintain when it grows.

---

#### 🔗 Why Is It Tightly Coupled?

In a monolith, **every module directly interacts with others** using function calls or shared classes. There’s **no hard boundary** between components.

#### 🧠 Real-World Result:
- Changing one part can **accidentally break** another.
- **Testing** becomes harder, because all parts are dependent.
- **Scaling** independently is impossible — you have to scale the whole app even if only one module needs it.

---

#### 📱 Example: Instagram as a Monolith (Early Stage)

In its early days, Instagram likely had:
- One server handling **user logins**, **photo uploads**, **comments**, **likes**, **notifications**, and **feed generation** — all in one application.

This worked perfectly fine when the user base was small and the product was evolving fast.

---

#### ✅ Advantages of Monolithic Architecture

| Benefit                     | Why It Matters                                                                 |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 **Simplicity**          | Easier to develop, test, and understand when you're starting out                |
| 🚀 **Fast development**    | No inter-service communication or complex deployments                          |
| 🛠️ **Single deployment**   | One build, one deploy — especially great for small teams                        |
| ⚙️ **Performance**         | Internal method calls are faster than network calls (used in microservices)     |
| 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Easy collaboration** | All developers work in one codebase — no need to coordinate across services      |

---

#### ❌ Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture

| Limitation                  | Real-World Impact                                                                 |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔗 **Tight coupling**       | Modules depend on each other, making changes risky                               |
| 🔄 **Difficult to scale**   | You can't scale just the part that needs resources (e.g., image uploads)          |
| 🧪 **Hard to test**         | End-to-end tests can be slow and brittle                                          |
| 🐞 **One bug can break all**| A crash in one module (e.g., notifications) can take down the whole app           |
| 🧩 **Slows down teams**     | As codebase grows, onboarding becomes harder and developer velocity drops         |
| ⚠️ **Long deployments**     | A small change to one feature needs the entire app to be rebuilt and redeployed   |

---

#### 👣 When Is Monolith a Good Choice?

- You’re building an **MVP or early-stage product**
- The **team is small** (2–5 developers)
- You want **quick iterations** and fewer moving parts
- The system won’t need to scale rapidly in the short term

---

#### 🔄 When to Move Away from a Monolith?

As the product grows:
- Different modules (like `notifications`, `feeds`, `auth`) grow in complexity
- Deployment takes longer
- Teams step on each other’s toes
- Scalability becomes a bottleneck

That’s when **splitting the monolith into microservices** makes sense.

---

### 🧩 Microservices Architecture – Breaking the Giant

#### 💡 What is Microservices Architecture?

**Microservices architecture** is an approach where an application is structured as a collection of **independent, loosely coupled services**, each responsible for a **specific business capability**.

Each service:
- Has its **own codebase**
- Runs as an **independent process**
- Communicates with others over the **network** (usually via HTTP/REST, gRPC, or message queues)
- Can be **developed, deployed, and scaled** independently

---

#### 🔄 Real-World Analogy

Imagine a restaurant:
- The **chef**, **cashier**, **waiter**, and **cleaning crew** all have different roles.
- They can operate independently but work together to serve customers.

In software terms:
- `User Service`, `Feed Service`, `Notification Service`, `Auth Service` — all separate microservices working together.

---

#### 📱 Example: Instagram as Microservices

Modern Instagram likely runs:
- A **User Service** (handles profiles, logins)
- A **Media Service** (stores & serves images/videos)
- A **Feed Service** (curates timeline)
- A **Like/Comment Service**
- A **Notification Service**

Each of these can be developed, deployed, monitored, and scaled independently.

#### ❌ Disadvantages of Microservices Architecture

| Limitation                    | Real-World Impact                                                                 |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌐 **Network complexity**     | Inter-service communication adds latency and requires robust APIs                |
| ⚙️ **Operational overhead**   | More services = more deployments, monitoring, logging, alerting                  |
| 🔒 **Data consistency**       | Achieving consistency across services is tricky (distributed transactions)        |
| 🧪 **Testing is harder**      | End-to-end testing becomes complex due to dependencies                           |
| 🔄 **Versioning challenges**  | Updating APIs without breaking consumers requires careful versioning             |
| 📦 **Infrastructure cost**    | Running many services needs container orchestration (like Kubernetes)            |

---

#### 🔗 How Do Microservices Talk to Each Other?

Common communication patterns:
- **HTTP APIs (REST, GraphQL)**
- **gRPC** (for faster, binary communication)
- **Message Brokers** (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS for async communication)

---

#### 🏗️ Design Best Practices

- Each microservice should have its **own database**
- Use **API gateways** to route and secure requests
- Embrace **event-driven architecture** for loosely coupled communication
- Centralized **logging, monitoring, and alerting** are a must
- Handle **failures gracefully** with retries, timeouts, circuit breakers

---

#### 🧠 When to Choose Microservices?

Choose microservices if:
- Your team is **large and divided by business domains**
- The app has **clearly separable concerns**
- You need **independent deployments** to move faster
- There’s a need to **scale parts of your system differently**

---

#### 📵 When Not to Use Microservices?

Avoid microservices if:
- You’re building an **MVP** or early prototype
- The team is **small**
- You want **simple deployment**
- You don’t have **DevOps maturity** (CI/CD, monitoring, container orchestration)

---

#### 🚀 Pro Tip

> Microservices = Move fast, scale better, but **requires strong engineering maturity**.

#### 🧠 Summary

- **Start with monolith** when speed and simplicity matter.
- **Move to microservices** as complexity grows and teams scale.

### 🔄 Monolith to Microservices Migration

As systems grow in complexity, many teams reach a point where their **monolithic architecture becomes a bottleneck** — in scalability, deployments, team autonomy, or reliability.

This is when organizations start considering **migration to microservices**.

---

#### 🚧 Why Migrate?

| Pain Point in Monolith                   | Benefit in Microservices                                |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Deployment of entire system for small changes | Deploy only what you change                              |
| One bug can crash the whole app          | Isolate failures to individual services                  |
| Difficult to scale specific modules      | Independently scale heavy services (e.g., media, feed)   |
| Teams stepping on each other’s toes      | Teams own separate services and can move independently   |
| Long build & deployment times            | Parallel development and deployments                     |

---

#### 🗺️ Migration Strategy: Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. **Assess the Monolith**
- Identify pain points: tight coupling, slow deploys, scalability issues.
- Use observability tools to monitor which modules consume the most resources.
- Get buy-in from all stakeholders (engineering, product, DevOps).

---

#### 2. **Establish Domain Boundaries**
- Use **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to break down the system by business capability.
  - Examples: Auth, Payments, Orders, Notifications, Search, etc.
- Aim for **loose coupling and high cohesion** in each domain.

---

#### 3. **Pick the First Service**
Start small. Good candidates:
- Modules with **minimal dependencies**
- High **read/write load**
- Services that benefit from **independent scaling**

📦 Example: Start with `Auth Service` or `Media Upload Service`

---

#### 4. **Extract the Service**
- Create a new codebase (or folder) for the microservice.
- Choose tech stack & database (optional but recommended to separate).
- Set up API contracts between monolith and service (REST, gRPC, etc.).

---

#### 5. **Set Up Communication**
- Add a **service layer or gateway** in the monolith to forward requests to the new service.
- Use **message queues** (like Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous tasks.
- Ensure **backward compatibility** during the transition.

---

#### 6. **Migrate Data**
- Copy relevant data to the new service’s database.
- Sync data temporarily using change data capture (CDC) or event queues.
- Slowly start routing traffic to the microservice once it’s ready.

---

#### 7. **Deploy & Monitor**
- Deploy the new service in production (canary or A/B deployment).
- Monitor logs, metrics, errors, and performance.
- Gradually increase traffic to the new service.

---

#### 8. **Refactor & Repeat**
- Once the first migration is stable, pick the next service.
- Eventually, the monolith will become smaller and act like a **thin shell** or gateway.

---

#### 🔐 Key Considerations

- **Data Consistency:** Use eventual consistency and events (outbox pattern).
- **API Contract Management:** Define clear contracts and version them carefully.
- **Observability:** Centralized logging, tracing, and monitoring are essential.
- **DevOps Maturity:** CI/CD pipelines, containers (Docker), and orchestration (Kubernetes) are needed.
- **Resilience:** Implement retries, circuit breakers, and timeouts.

#### 🧠 Real-World Example: Instagram

| Stage            | Architecture Type           | Notes                                                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Early (2010)     | Monolith                    | PHP + PostgreSQL, all-in-one app                      |
| Scale-up (2015)  | Hybrid (Monolith + Services)| Gradually extracted services like notifications       |
| Modern (Now)     | Microservices               | Fully modular, event-driven services at global scale  |

---

#### ✅ Final Thought

> Migration to microservices isn’t just a tech change — it’s an organizational and cultural shift.

Start small, move safely, and prioritize **observability, resilience, and ownership**.
